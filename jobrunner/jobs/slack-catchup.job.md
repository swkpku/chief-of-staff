# Slack Catchup

## Schedule
30 9 * * 1-5

## Goal
Scan my Slack channels each weekday morning and catch me up on what I missed.
Identify threads where I should participate — questions directed at me, decisions needing my input,
or conversations where my reply is expected — and draft replies for my approval.
Also summarize overnight activity and flag urgent DMs or mentions.

## Policy
- Summarize messages from: #engineering, #incidents, #team-standup, #general
- Ignore bot messages and automated alerts older than 12 hours
- Prioritize finding threads that need my reply over general summaries
- Draft context-aware thread replies that match my communication style
- Flag any DMs or @mentions that are unanswered
- Include a brief overnight activity summary

## Boundaries
- Never post messages or replies without approval
- Never join or leave channels
- Never react to or delete messages
- Never read channels outside the approved list

## Tools
- slack
